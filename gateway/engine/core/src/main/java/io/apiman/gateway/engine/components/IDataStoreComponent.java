/**
 * A Component that allows policies to share data across invocations and potentially
 * across nodes (depending on the implementation). The data managed will be related to
 * requests and/or responses such as {@link CachedResponse} instances
 *
 * It is up to the implementation of this component to determine how transactional
 * it might be (there are time vs. accuracy tradeoffs to be made here).  Users
 * of API Management will need to ensure they use an appropriate implementation
 * of this component based on the data integrity/accuracy guarantees they require.
 * 
 * All operations in this component are assumed to be asyncrhonous, so a handler
 * must be provided if the policy implementation needs the operation to finish
 * prior to moving on.
